# SourceCombiner
Combines c# source files into a single .cs file. This is useful if you are working with multiple files or projects but the resulting code must be submitted somewhere that only accepts a single file as input.

Works with multiple projects when they are included in the solution.

Example from command line:
> SourceCombiner C:\TestProjects\SourceCombiner\SourceCombiner.sln c:\temp\solution.cs true
